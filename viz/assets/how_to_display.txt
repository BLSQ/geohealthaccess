When the access estimates by health zone option is selected, it is possible to display the data in three different ways :
Percent of population without access in each zone : this is a good way to identify health districts with the lowest level of accessibility of health services.
Percent of population without access with zone population: this is a good way to identify most populous health districts and check the  level of access to care 
Number of people without access to care : this is the best way to identify where people donâ€™t have access to care and how many people are affected.
