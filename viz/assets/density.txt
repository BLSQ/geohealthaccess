This graphic shows the cumulative proportion of people in a health zone with access to care under increasing travel times. To change the health zone displayed, simply move the mouse to hover over another part of the map. (Note: this view is only available when 'Access estimates by health zone' is selected)
Such a cross-cutting view of travel times allows a better understanding of the question of access in a given area. Steep increases in the proportion with access might point to acute issues with stockouts of medication or lack of personnel, while a flatter curve may indicate an area that is chronically underserved.
